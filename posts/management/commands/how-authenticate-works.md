Great question! The `authenticate` method in Django works by verifying user credentials against the stored data in the database. Here's how it works internally:

1. **Hashing the Password**:
   When you call the `authenticate` method with a username and password, Django first hashes the provided password using the same hashing algorithm and salt that was used when the password was originally set.

2. **Querying the Database**:
   Django then queries the database to find a user with the provided username. It uses the built-in User model from `django.contrib.auth.models.User`. This model is backed by a database table that stores user information, including hashed passwords.

3. **Comparing Password Hashes**:
   Once the user is found, Django compares the hashed version of the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database. If the hashes match, it means the provided password is correct.

4. **Returning the User Object**:
   If the credentials are valid (i.e., the username exists and the password is correct), Django returns the corresponding User object. If the credentials are invalid, it returns `None`.

The database where the user information is stored is typically defined in your Django project's settings file (`settings.py`). By default, Django uses SQLite for development purposes, but you can configure it to use other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle.

### Example of How It Works

Here's a simplified version of the process:

```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate

# Authenticating a user
user = authenticate(username="john_doe", password="mypassword123")
if user is not None:
    print("Authentication successful!")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")
```

- **User Model**: The default model is `django.contrib.auth.models.User`.
- **Database**: Defined in `settings.py` (default is SQLite, but can be configured).

The `authenticate` method ensures that plain-text passwords are never stored or transmitted, making it a secure way to handle user authentication.


# What happened to my own definition of User model in my models.py? Does it ignores it when Django uses authenticate method?

When you create your own custom User model, you need to tell Django to use it instead of the default User model provided by `django.contrib.auth.models.User`. This is done by updating your projectâ€™s settings. Here's what you need to do to ensure your custom User model is used with the `authenticate` method:

### 1. Define Your Custom User Model
Ensure your custom User model is defined properly in `models.py`.

**Example: `models.py`**

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager
from django.db import models

class MyUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)

class MyUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_superuser = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    objects = MyUserManager()

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['first_name', 'last_name']
```

### 2. Update Your Settings
In your `settings.py` file, specify that your project should use your custom User model.

**Example: `settings.py`**

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'your_app_name.MyUser'
```

Replace `'your_app_name'` with the name of the app where your custom User model is defined.

### 3. Using the Custom User Model with `authenticate`
The `authenticate` method will now use your custom User model when verifying credentials. You don't need to make any changes to the `authenticate` method itself.

**Example: Authentication Code**

```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate

# Authenticating a user
user = authenticate(username="user@example.com", password="mypassword123")
if user is not None:
    print("Authentication successful!")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")
```

By setting `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, you ensure that Django uses your custom User model for all authentication and user management tasks. This includes the `authenticate` method and other built-in authentication mechanisms.

## How to resolve the is_anonymous attribute?

Thank you for sharing your `User` model code. It seems like your custom user model lacks the typical attributes and methods present in Django's default user model, such as `is_anonymous`.

To solve this issue, you can extend Django's `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin` classes instead of the base `models.Model` class. Here's an updated version of your model:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin
from django.db import models

class UserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, username, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(username=username, email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, username, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)

        return self.create_user(username, email, password, **extra_fields)

class User(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True) # User's unique username
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True) # User's unique email
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) # Timestamp when the user was created
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False) # For admin user
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True) # For activating the user

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'username'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['email']

    objects = UserManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

This updated model does the following:
1. Extends `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`, which provide the necessary user authentication fields and methods.
2. Implements `UserManager` to handle user and superuser creation.
3. Adds the `is_staff` and `is_active` fields to manage user statuses.
4. Provides a manager to manage user objects.

You should also update your settings to refer to the custom user model:
```python
# settings.py
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'your_app_name.User'
```

After making these changes, run the following commands to create and apply the migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

This should resolve the `AttributeError` regarding the `is_anonymous` attribute. Let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification!

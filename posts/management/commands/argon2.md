## Resolving issue installing Argon2 password hasher from project's settings.py

It looks like you're running into an issue with building the `argon2` package. This is a common problem, especially on Windows. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this:

### 1. Install Required Build Tools
Make sure you have the necessary build tools installed. For Windows, you can install the Visual C++ Build Tools. You can download them from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

### 2. Install `argon2-cffi`
Instead of installing `argon2` directly, you can try installing `argon2-cffi`, which is a more commonly used package for Argon2 in Python. Run the following command:
```bash
pip install argon2-cffi
```

### 3. Update `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`
Ensure that your `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` are up to date. Run the following commands:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 4. Use a Pre-built Wheel
If the above steps don't work, you can try using a pre-built wheel for `argon2-cffi`. You can find pre-built wheels on [this website](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). Download the appropriate wheel file for your Python version and install it using:
```bash
pip install path_to_downloaded_wheel_file
```

### 5. Check for Compatibility Issues
Ensure that your Python version is compatible with the version of `argon2` or `argon2-cffi` you are trying to install. Sometimes, compatibility issues can cause installation failures.
